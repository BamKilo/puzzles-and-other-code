How to update the werewolf database:

# test in dev first
# copy over Poster, Thread tables
delete from dev.Thread;
insert into dev.Thread select * from fennecfox.Thread where subforumid < 1000;
delete from dev.Poster;
insert into dev.Poster select * from fennecfox.Poster;
# fix url russians are coming / monkey
# fix url disney http
# #3 champs game, victors wolves
# fix revenge of burn notice, all fucked up



# make sure that the db is updated using fennecfox
# take the ww data wwdbcombined.xls file
# remove the 12th and 13th columns (Post Restriction, Special Rules) since this script is not up to date with those changes
# make sure date format is readable
# sort by date, gamename (not really necessary)
# make sure urls are good; needs the "http://" part
# save as text file, tab delimited
# run: python readwwcsv.py -i wwdbcombined.txt -o wwupdate.sql
# this generates wwupdate.sql
# in mysql: delete from fennecfox.Thread where subforumid >= 1000;
# because we created "synthetic" threads in the db last time we uploaded non-2p2 games. they need to be refreshed
# run in command line: 
mysql fennecfox < wwupdate.sql -upogwwdb -pwerewolf
# on the server to delete old data and add new
# remove all apostrophes from game names, since the special characters are used in the address bar to point to the game's webpage and... it doesn't work
update Game set gamename='Les Miserables' where gamename like "Les Mis%";
update Game set gamename = replace(gamename, "'", "") where gamename like "%'%";

# adjust threadids for non-2p2
update Thread set threadid = threadid + 3000000 where subforumid = 1000;
update Thread set threadid = threadid + 3100000 where subforumid = 3;
update Thread set threadid = threadid + 3200000 where subforumid = 2000;

# gimmicks:

truncate Gimmick;
mysql fennecfox < gimmicks_20140412.sql -upogwwdb -pwerewolf

# player records
mysql fennecfox < derived.sql -upogwwdb -pwerewolf

# ELO
don't know how
